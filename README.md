# PatentAnalysis

Patents have long been granted by governments in order to award innovation. They are given when a patent specification is filed for an invention. This specification typically includes a detailed explanation as well as figures to illustrate the breakthrough which was reached by the innovator. It is hence a key medium to communicate innovation.

In this study, we aim to improve our understanding of patents as well as our approach to analyzing these documents in a digital fashion. To this end, we focus on a corpus of American and British patents. After testing several methods for drawing detection on the documents, we then move on to digitizing the them through OCR and analyzing the evolution of certain linguistic aspects of patent documents.
