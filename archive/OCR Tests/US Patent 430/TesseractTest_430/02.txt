UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE.

MODE OF CONSTRUCTING AND FASTENING IRON RAILS ON THE TIMBERS OF
RAILWAYS,

Specification of Letters Patent No, 430, dated October 18, 1837.

To all whom tt may concern:

Beit known that I, Perer Henry Dreyer,
of the city of New York, in the county and
State of New York, have invented a new
and Improved Mode of Constructing, Fas-
tening, and Securing Iron Rails on Tim-
bers of Railways; and I do hereby declare
that the following (with the annexed draw-
ings) is a full and exact description thereof.

J lay the dovetail-grooved iron rail repre-
sented by A in Figure 1, from its side and
A, Figs. 2 and 7, from its end, in the timber
or stringpiece. B, Figs. 1, 2 and 7, after the
iron bolt with a dovetailed upperpart, Fig.
3, ¢, é, has been passed through the wood
and is so turned, that the dovetailed groove
of the rail can pass the top of the bolt, which
must be straight one way and dovetailed the
other, as is shown by Fig. 8, ¢, e. This be-
ing done, the rail is pushed forward on the
dovetailed plate Fig. 4, a, b, c, Fig. 1, C, C,
Fig. 6, c, and Fig. 7, ¢, so far, that the next
rail to be laid on can meet it on the middle
of this plate, and then the dovetailed bolt
is so turned from below, that the same and
the dovetail of the plate perfectly fasten
and secure the rail-by its dovetailed groove
on the timber or stringpiece of the railway,
when the wedgekey is driven through the
open lower part of the bolt and-its grooved
plate, which is slipped from below over the
bolt up to the timber after the bolt is turned
to receive the wedgekey. See Fig. 3, e,
Fig. 2, d, e, f, and Fig. 5, d, e, f. ,

For further explanation I delineate sepa-
rately in Fig. 4, the cast iron dovetail plate,
in a, from the top or upper surface, 6, from
its side and ¢, from its end. In Fig. 5, the
cast iron bolt or wedging plate with its
groove, @, showing the lower part with the
groove from two sides, e, the upper surface
with four prints, to be pressed into the
wood by the wedgekey and /, the under-
neath part or surface with the groove. In

Fig. 6, the exact size of a cast iron dovetail
plate for a rail of one inch or less thickness
as it is fastened to the inside of the string-
piece by two screws, whereof one is likewise

to be seen in Fig. 7, c, and another of the
two fastening it to the top of the timber,
which Fig. 7, shows the end of a dovetail
grooved rail of one inch thickness with ¢,
the end of the cast-iron dovetailed plate and
the screws by which it is fastened to. the
top and inside of the stringpiece or timber.
In Fig. 8, the end of a dovetail grooved rail
of two inches thickness.

The peculiar advantages of my new plan
to secure the iron rail on the stringpiece by
the greatest mechanical power of the wedge
are obvious and may be brought under the
following principal heads, viz: 1. The
continuity of the upper surface of the rail
in all cases, whether the foundation may
yield to weight passing over it or not, there
being a complete bond between the iron and
the wood. 2. The removal of the dangers
of. the old mode of fastening the rail by

spikes through holes of the plate rail or:

spikes driven in at the sides of the edge-
rail, because my dovetailed bolt can never
rise. 3. The considerable saving of costs in
the dovetail grooved iron rail, which is of
equal strength and durability with the pres-

ent more costly shape and weight of the rail -
4. The ease with which for -

in common use.
repairs, without injuring .the timber and

55

iron, the rails can be removed and replaced, —
which requires only the removal of the -

wedgekey and the turning of the bolts, no
spikes being used, besides the unscrewing
of two dovetail plates for any distance of
the road. ©

What I claim as my invention and desire
to secure by Letters Patent, is—

The dovetail grooved rails, dovetailed
bolts and. plates and grooved wedge plates,
applied to the construction of railways, by
which means and the wedgekey the iron
dovetail grooved rail is perfectly and most
substantially secured on the stringpiece or
timber of the railroad.
