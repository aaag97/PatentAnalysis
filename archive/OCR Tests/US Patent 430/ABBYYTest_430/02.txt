                         Specification of Letters Patent No. 430, dated October 18, 1837.                                          
                                                                                                                                    
To dll whom, it may concern:                                                      to be seen in Fig. 7, c, and another of the       
                            Be it known that I, Peter Henry Dreyer,               two fastening it to the top of the timber, 50     
                         of the city of New York, in the county and               which Fig. 7, shows the end of a dovetail         
                             State of New York, have invented a new               grooved rail of one inch thickness with <?,       
                       f- 5 and Improved Mode of Constructing, Fas-               the end of the cast-iron dovetailed plate and     
                            tening, and Securing Iron Rails on Tim-               the screws by which it is fastened to the         
                          bers of Railways; and I do hereby declare               top and inside of the stringpiece or timber. 55   
                         that the following (with the annexed draw-               In Fig. 8, the end of a dovetail grooved rail     
                     ings) is a full and exact description thereof.               of two inches thickness.                          
10 I lay the dovetail grooved iron rail repre-                                    The peculiar advantages of my new plan            
sented by A in Figure 1, from its side and                                        to secure the iron rail on the stringpiece by     
A, Figs. 2 and 7, from its end, in the timber                                     the greatest mechanical power of the wedge 60     
or stringpiece. B, Figs. 1, 2 and 7, after the                                    are obvious and may be brought under the          
iron bolt with a dovetailed upperpart, Fig.                                       following principal heads, viz: 1. The            
15 3, e, e, has been passed through the wood                                      continuity of the upper surface of the rail       
and is so turned, that the dovetailed groove                                      in all cases, whether the foundation may          
of the rail can pass the top of the bolt, which                                   yield to weight passing over it or not, there 65  
must be straight one way and dovetailed the                                       being a complete bond between the iron and        
other, as is shown by Fig. 3, e, e. This be-                                      the wood. 2. The removal of the dangers           
20 ing done, the rail is pushed forward on the                                    of the old mode of fastening the rail by          
dovetailed plate Fig. 4, a, 5, <?, Fig. 1, C, C,                                  spikes through holes of the plate rail or         
Fig. 6, c, and Fig. 7, c, so far, that the next                                   spikes driven in at the sides of the edge- 70     
' rail to be laid on can meet it on the middle                                    rail, because my dovetailed bolt can never        
of this plate, and then the dovetailed bolt                                       rise. 3. The considerable saving of costs in      
25 is so turned from below, that the same and                                     the dovetail grooved iron rail, which is of       
the dovetail of the plate perfectly fasten                                        equal strength and durability with the pres-      
and secure the rail by its dovetailed groove                                      ent more costly shape and weight of the rail 75   
on the timber or stringpiece of the railway,                                      in common use. 4. The ease with which for         
when the wedgekey is driven through the                                           repairs, without injuring the timber and          
30 open lower part of the bolt and its grooved                                    iron, the rails can be removed and replaced,      
plate, which is slipped from below over the                                       which requires only the removal of the            
bolt up to the timber after the bolt is turned                                    wedgekey and the turning of the bolts, no 80      
to receive the wedgekey. See Fig. 3, e,                                           spikes being used, besides the unscrewing
