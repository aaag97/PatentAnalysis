       " 'To all whom tt may concern: Be it known that I,SerH Lams, of the city,\\ncounty,and State of New York, have invented,\\nconstructed, and applied to use a new and use- ‘ful Improvement in the Machinery for Cutting Gro sd4ndGrain; andI do hereby declare that\\nthe rollowing is a fall and exact description\\nthereof, with reference to the accompanying\\ndrawings, making part of this specification,\\nand in which the same parts are designated\\nby the same letters of reference in all the dif-\\nferent figures. Figure 1 represents a vertical projection of\\nthe geared side of the machine; Fig. 2, a top\\nview, witha part of the floor or casing removed\\nto exhibit the sickle-wheel, gearing, and pal-\\nleys and to exhibit their connection and posi-\\ntion with the frame of the machine; Fig. 3, a\\nfront vertical projection. Tig. 4 is a perspec-\\ntive view of the sickle guides or rests, with bows\\nor guards extending from the front points of\\nthe guides to the front edge of the platform. The nature of my invention consists in at-\\ntaching sickles to a horizontal wheel, which is\\nplaced near the front end at the inside of the\\nmachine. Placed beneath thesickle-wheel are\\nguides that project forward and gather the\\ngrain or grass, and serve as rests for the re- volving sickles toseverthe stalk or blade from { the roots, and at such height from the ground\\nas desired. This machine is about. nine feet long and\\nseven wide, including the wheels, and is di-\\nvided longitudinally into two nearly equal\\nparts. The inner or sickle-wheel side or the\\nplatform A, Figs. 2, 8, and 4, is placed near\\nthe ground, and its forward end, containing\\nthe sickle-wheel B,is adjusted to the requisite\\nheight for eutting grass or grain by the thills\\nCO, which are attached to the machine by con-\\nfining-bolts a, which form a fulerum for the\\nthills C to turn upon to regulate the height of ’ the sickle-wheel, aud the thills are secured in the requisite position by a bolt, 6’, at the back\\nend of the front thill, which is placed within a\\nguide, C’, containing a number of holes, to suit\\nthe various inclinations of the thills that may\\nbe required in cutting different kinds of grass\\nor grain, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. The bolt | any position desired. The inner thill, C, placed\\nnear the middle of the machine, has only the\\nconfining-bolt a’, as seen at Fig. 2. The center and back part of the platform A,\\nwhich lies back of the sickle-wheel, on which\\nthe grain and grass are received when cut, is\\nconstructed sufficiently to admit the inner car-\\nriage-wheel, D, to pass freely within the stand-\\ning grain and over the stubble ground, asseen\\nat Fig. 2. The two front guards, E and F, at\\ntheir forward points are nearly double the\\nwidth of the platform A within the wheels,\\nand of such heightas tosceure the grain within\\nthem, and their back ends are contracted to\\nconform to the narrow part of the platform A,\\nFigs. 1, 2, and 3. The sickle-wheel or center B-is about four\\nfeet in diameter, and is formed of metal, with\\nan external rim, to which the sickles H are at-\\ntached. Within this rin’ a sunk gear, IJ, is\\nformed. The points of the teeth are ova plane\\nwith the upper face of the rim, and the spaces\\nbetween the teeth may be formed into open ap-\\nertures, or closed at the bottom, as preferred.\\nWithin the gearing there is another rim, and\\nthe two tims support the ends of the teeth,\\nas they are firmly united thereto. From the\\ninner rimarms project inward and unite at the\\ncenter and form a hub, with an axle, J, in the\\ncenter thereof, which projects above and below\\nthe bub, and turn in boxes ‘placed in the un-\\nder frame and the casing above the wheel,\\nwhich is removed to exhibit the wheel B, and\\nseen at Fig. 2. : The sickles Hl are attached to the outer rim\\nof the wheel B by bolts or screws, and are\\nabout twelve in number, and their curvature\\nand inclination forward are such as to gather\\nthe grain. Near their center or inner end the\\nteeth upon the edge of the sickle are placed\\nobliquely thereto, projecting: both forward and\\noutward, and as they come in contact with the\\ngrain, which is held by the guides or rests G,\\nthe rotary motion of the sickles gives a draw-\\ning stroke, which severs the stalk or blade\\nfrom the bottom part, similar to the avtion of\\nthe common sickle by manual labor, which is\\neffected by the curve and inclination of the\\nsickle and the form and position of the guides b! passes through the guide e’, the thills C, and | or rests G, as seen at Fig. 2. into the machine, thus confining it firmly to The guides or rests G may havea sharp cut- w~w 1,645 ‘ting-edge or teeth, similar to those on. the ! verse line with the center of the wheel B. The sickles, as most advantageous to the well per-\\nformance of the machine. The rests G are\\nabout nine in number, and their outer or front\\nends are pointed, and their back ends are se-\\ncured to asegment-rim, gq, directly in front and\\nnearly in contact with the wheel B. The rests\\nGare formed in separate pieces, and connected\\nto the rim g by bolts and nuts or rivets, as may\\nbe preferred, as shown at Fig.2. Thesides of\\nthe guides or rests are curved, and the curves\\nof the inner adjacent guides unite at the outer\\nedge of the segment-rim. ‘The guides extend forward of the sickles H.\\nand gather the grain therefor; but\\'they donot exactly radiate from the center of the wheel B,. but are placed as nigh parallel as the action of\\nthe sickles will admit; and the shape of the\\nguides are varied, that each guide may have\\nsuch a form and position that the sickles H\\nJnay act upon the stalk or blade with a draw-\\n‘ing stroke at that part of the guide where it\\nsevers the top from the bottom, and not cut at\\nright angles with any of the guides, as shown\\nat Figs. 2 and 4. . The ends of the rim g are secured. to the\\nframe, and also to the longitudinal pieces « of\\nthe bottom frame, to give it the necessary so-\\nlidity. From the points of the guides G bows\\nor guards K extend to the front of the plat- form, which covers the wheel B, Figs. 2 and 4, The guards K are placed above the sickles H, and admitof their turning freely beneath them,\\nand they only operate upon the grain after it\\nhas been severed from the bottom, and ‘pre-\\nvent the sickles from giving it a whirling mo- tion or carrying it to the side of the machine;\\nbut they retain it in the place where it is cut, and it falls within the body of the machine, as\\nshown at Figs.2 and 4. The frame beneath\\nthis part of the machine, at the forward end, is\\nas thin as the nature and strength of the ma-\\nchine will, permit, and is composed of’ three\\nlongitudinal pieces, a, firmly secured by as\\nmany transverse pieces b as necessary to give\\nthe requisite support. At the outer or geared side.of the machive\\nis placed a carriage-wheel, D’,and corresponds\\nwith the wheel D at the opposite side of the\\nmachine, as seen at Figs. 2 and 3. The outer wheel, D’, is placed.a sufficient distance from.\\nthe machine to receive a gear-wheel, L, within. it, and is secured to theinner side of the wheel,\\nand is of nearly the same diameter. The\\nwheels D/ and I propel the sickle-wheel by the\\nadhesion of the carriage-wheel to the ground.\\nThe wheel L connects with and gives motion\\nto a pinion; M, placed in front of. the wheel L,\\nand is attached to the outer end of the shaft\\nN. At the opposite end of this shaft, and be-\\nneath the platform R, a pulley, O, is ‘secured,\\nand is near the partition or side of the plat:\\nform A. From this pulley a band passes toa\\ncorresponding pulley, P, of smaller dimensions,\\nin front of the large pulley O and on 4 trans- shaft N and the axle ofthe pulley P are placed\\nin suitable boxes and connected to the machine\\nby stands. . Within the pulley P another gear- wheel, Q,.is placed, and is secured to the same shaft or axle, and gives motion to the wheel\\nB, to which the sickles H are attached, as seen\\nat Figs. land 2. The gear Q econvects with\\naud gives motion to the sunk wheel I within\\nthe rims of the wheel B, and the proportions\\nof the different wheels and pulleys are such as ‘to give the sickles a velocity capable of sever- ing the grain as the machine advances over\\nthe ground. The platform R of the geared or\\nout side of the machine is raised sufficient to\\nadmit the axle-tree S of the wheel D’ beneath\\nit, and at the inner end of this axlé-tree a me-\\ntallic bar, 8’, is sécured, and passes down and\\nunder the platform A, and rises at. the oppo-\\nsite sideof-the machine to’ the same height of the axle-tree 8, and forms theaxle forthe wheel. D, Figs. Land 2. \"At the outside of f platform Ra frame of pan-\\nel-work, #, rises-Sufficiently high ‘to prevent\\nthe grain from becoming entangled i in the gear-\\ning Lor wheel D/ on the outside of the ma-\\nchine when placed upon the platform R, as seen\\nat Figs.1and3, The grain upon the platform\\nA may be removed as often as occasion may\\nrequire and depositéd upon the platform BR in\\nquantity sufficient forfifteen or twenty bundles\\nbefore it is removed from the machine. The sickle-wheel is placed at the inside of\\nthe machine, and occupies but a little more\\nthan one-balfof the width of the machine, while\\nthe platform A, on which the grain is received\\nfrom the sickle-wheel, is contracted and less\\nin width than the platform B at the outside of\\nthe machine, which forms a receptacle for the\\ndeposit of grain. By this arrangement the\\nhorse can travel i in front.of the platform R, at the outside of the machine and by the side of . the standing grain, in advance of the sickle:\\nwheel, which is at the opposite side.of the ma- chine, and projects nearly its whole size into the standing grain, which it cuts and deposits\\nupon the platform a as the machine. advances.\\nAnother advantage is derived by placing the\\nsickle-wheel at the inside of the machine—the\\nformation of the raised platform R for the de- _posit of grain which accumulates upon the platform A, and is removed. therefrom and\\nplaced npon the platform R in quantities suf- icient to form a number of sheaves, thus per- forming the operation of cutting and collect-\\ning together the grain at one operation, thus avoiding the trouble ofcollecting single sheaves by manual labor.
